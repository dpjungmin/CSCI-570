| [Strongly Connected Component](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2150) | [C++20](solution.cpp) | Kosaraju's Algorithm |

A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path from any point to any other point in the graph.

When `|V| = n` and `|E| = m`, finding all strongly connected components would take `O(n + m)`.
